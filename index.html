 		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I love anime, sports, and entrepreneurship. I graduated from Georgia Southern University, the <b>REAL</b> GSU, with a Bachelors in Multimedia Communications. After working part-time as a freelance sports writer, I earned my Masters degree in Accounting with a Tax Emphasis. I worked for 6 years in various roles for a property management company.</p>
  		<p>During my time in property management, I was an avid reader of non-fiction books by or about successful people. I stumbled upon a book called "The Four Hour Work Week" by Tim Ferris. I fell in love with the entire concept of living abroad and utilizing technology to free myself to explore the world.</p>
  		<p>I believe technology has a way of helping so many people achieve their dreams while also connecting people previous separated due to distance. Technology is now in almost every thing we do in some form. As a student at Thinkful, I'm hoping to learn the skills needed to unlock not only my, but individual's and company's potential.</p>
  		<p>If you're looking to hire someone willing to grow with you and help achieve your goals, then please <a href="#contact">contact me</a>. I can't wait to help build and work on interesting new software and apps!</p>
